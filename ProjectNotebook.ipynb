    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The User Information Based Encryption System is a program that use the the information you give to perform encryption and decryption with the algorithm of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to make a encryption system that prompt for user information and make use of them in the process of encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cipher Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Currrently, the system let you encrypt your data with two cipher algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Substitution Cipher:\n",
    "    * encryption - construct a table that map every character to another character, them substitute every character in the text with the table.\n",
    "    * decryption - reverse the mapping table and them use the same function as above to map the characters back.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Affine Cipher:\n",
    "    * encryption - (a * character + b) % m, where m is size of alphabet (which is 256 is this case) and a is coprime to m\n",
    "    * decryption - (a_inverse * (character - b)) % m, where a_inverse * a % m == 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wish More Time For ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially I wanted to let the user choose from more encryption algorithms such as RSA and AES, but after taking quite some time to research, I feel like I wouldn't have enough time to implement all of them, which turns out to be true, not to mention I need to make use of the information. Therefore, I chose to combine two different encryption algorithms, substitution and affine cipher, which are relatively more manageable for me and easier to make use of user input, even though the still took much longer than I expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, I used the user information to generate a number, and then use it as a random seed for substitution cipher, or a base number to compute a and b in Affine Cipher. If I had more time, I would like to find a more interesting way to make use of the information."

    "### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute the my_scrypt.py file, the system will be started.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First you need to input some information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Then you can choose whether you want to encrypt a text or decrypt a encrypted text.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Choose an algorithm to use, substitution cipher or affine cipher.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The system will then print out the encrypted/decrypted result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example input and output are shown below."
